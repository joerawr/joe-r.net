# **Summary** ![A long, thin rectangle to divide sections of the document][image1]

Site Reliability Engineering Manager (SRE Manager) with 20+ years across on‑prem to AWS, leading teams to modernize platforms with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform/Ansible), containers (ECS/EKS/Fargate, Docker), GitLab CI, and observability (Datadog/Splunk). Currently driving AI/LLM adoption (Bedrock, internal LLM tools, code assistants) to accelerate delivery. Cut release lead time from 1 day to 1 hour, new app spin‑up from 2 weeks to 2 days, and migrated 50+ services from EC2 to ECS. Passionate about coaching SREs, DORA metrics, and cost/MTTR reduction.

# **Core Digital Media** \- *Playa Vista, CA* **Site Reliability Engineer Manager** \- *July 2021 \- Present*

* Drove a major modernization initiative to containerize 50+ services from EC2 to ECS/Fargate, replatform CI/CD from AWS CodePipeline to GitLab CI, and migrate from self-hosted GitLab to GitLab Cloud Ultimate. Enabled shift-left testing, reusable pipelines, and AI-assisted reviews. Reduced new-service bootstrap from 14 to 2 days (‑86%) and release lead time from 24h to 1h (‑95%), while cutting infra and tooling costs 50% and standardizing deployments org-wide  
* Championed strategic cost optimization by actively managing AWS budgets, accurately forecasting usage, and recommending Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, consistently keeping infrastructure costs under budget and unlocking funds for innovation  
* Led a team of seven engineers to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, GitLab CI, and GitLab Runners, instilling a GitOps mindset that drove a 70% improvement in deployment efficiency and ensured consistent environment configurations across multiple projects.  
* Led the re-architecture of Disaster Recovery tooling to align with modern CI/CD workflows, ensuring automated failover readiness and resilience as part of our cloud-native transformation  
* Spearheaded migration of Infrastructure as Code tooling from end-of-life CentOS 7 to long-term support AlmaLinux, ensuring platform stability, security compliance, and future-proofing critical automation workflows  
* Initiated deployment of automated patching using TuxCare, enabling live kernel patching with zero reboots to enhance security posture—project was in progress at the time of role transition  
* Created internal python pydanticAI AWS Bedrock backed Slack Bot with a custom AWS Infra MCP server, championed AI code assistant tools, LLM adoption   
* Developed and led hands-on workshop**s** to upskill the team on containerization and orchestration, including Dockerizing Java apps, deploying to ECS, and running Kubernetes workloads. Created tailored labs and Terraform-powered Atlantis sandboxes for each engineer to practice in isolated, reproducible environments

# **Core Digital Media** \- *Playa Vista, CA* **Principal System Administrator** \- *Jan 2019 \- July 2021*

* Architected a multi-account, multi-region AWS infrastructure in collaboration with AWS Solutions Architects, hosting all production, QA, and development environments—including a pilot light disaster recovery setup for high availability and resilience

* Saved $2 million in VMWare hardware renewal costs by migrating 500 datacenter hosted VMWare VMs to AWS EC2 

* Executed annual live Disaster Recovery failover tests, seamlessly shifting 100% of client traffic to DR infrastructure to validate business continuity plans and meet insurance and contractual compliance requirements.  
* Using observability metrics, right sized our applications to dramatically reduced AWS costs by over 50%  
* Increased code deployment from once a week to once a day by migrating from Jenkins to Terraform module based AWS CI/CD Code Pipeline / Code Build / Code Deploy  
* Led GitOps adoption and Terraform standardization to enforce Infrastructure as Code best practices—eliminating one-off deployments, increasing reliability, and ensuring consistent, repeatable infrastructure across all environments


# **Lowermybills** \- *Playa Vista, CA* **Senior System Engineer** \- *Jan 2013 \- Dec 2018*

* Designed and built a highly available, bare-metal Kubernetes cluster with multi-master and multi-worker nodes, backed by NAS storage, and Cisco 10G switches. Deployed production-grade applications using Jenkins pipelines with real-world traffic and load profiles  
* Provisioned VMware-based Kubernetes clusters on vSphere using tools such as KOPS, Kubespray, and Terraform to support scalable, repeatable development environments  
* Complete data center migration from one colo to another (again) with only a few hours of downtime  
* Migrated infrastructure to Cisco UCS VSphere VMWare clusters and scaled to 1,000+ VMs, maintaining five parallel project environments in sync with production to accelerate development and support key business initiatives  
* Built automation tooling with Ansible to manage 1,000+ VMs—configuring security, user access, Splunk-based application logging, Nagios monitoring, and maintaining VMware agents—ensuring consistent, compliant environments across all stages

# **Experian Interactive Media** \- *Culver City, CA* **Senior System Engineer** \- *Dec 2008 – Jan 2013*

* Maintained 100% uptime during a 300-server datacenter migration

* Deployed Red Hat Satellite patching across 300 servers and instituted a monthly staged patching cycle across Dev → QA → Stage → Prod

* Consolidated DNS infrastructure to BIND 9 (primary/secondary) with zero downtime; migrated back office DNS from Microsoft AD to BIND

* Implemented VMWare with self managed ESX hosts to deliver scalable Stage/QA/DEV/ENG environments, leveraging P2V, cloning, LVM, and templates

* Introduced Puppet for configuration management, enabling consistent provisioning and lifecycle management of VMs across environments, reducing manual effort and configuration drift

# **Time Warner Cable** \- *Orange, CA* **System Engineer** \- *Jun 2001* \- *Dec 2008*

* Administered a large-scale Solaris and Red Hat environment, ensuring high availability and performance across critical infrastructure powering internet access for cable modem customers.  
* Maintained and supported essential customer-facing services including DNS, NFS, LDAP, and Sendmail—delivering always-on, utility-grade reliability for primary email and connectivity needs.
