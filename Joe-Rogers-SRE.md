# **Summary**

Site Reliability Engineer with experience designing, building, and operating Kubernetes (EKS and on-prem) clusters at scale, ECS, ECR, Fargate, AWS, and Terraform. Hands-on in cluster build-outs, upgrades, troubleshooting, observability, and automation. Modernized platforms with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Ansible), container orchestration (EKS/ECS/Fargate, Docker), and CI/CD (GitLab CI, Jenkins). Cut release lead time from 1 day to 1 hour, new app spin-up from 2 weeks to 2 days, and migrated 50+ services from EC2 to ECS. Passionate about driving operational excellence, mentoring engineers, and reducing MTTR and cost.
